Neuro-Evolving Shepherd Project:

For this project, I plan to implement a neuro-evolving 'shepherd' agent which interacts with a number of static (non-evolving) 'sheep' agents.  The goal of the shepherd is to keep the sheep contained.  The sheep have no goal, but their behaviors include avoiding the shepherd and grazing.

Steps required:

[ ] - initialize new population of shepherds (with NN brain) and their respective herds
[ ] - give shepherd location of each sheep in its herd as input to NN brain
[ ] - shepherd will move according to output of NN brain
[ ] - order population of shepherds by fitness
[ ] - create next generation of shepherds / herds
